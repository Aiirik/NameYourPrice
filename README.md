# NameYourPrice
Making my own "Name Your Price" plugin for Wordpress / WooCommerce. Very rough code.

Currently it loads your wordpress product categories and will allow 1 category to have the option to name your own price so that users can punch in a price they want to pay.

There are settings for custom currency symbol, Min / Max price, custom text and hopefully more to come.

Future plans is to make it so you can have multiple categories selected with their own settings (ex: one category from $0-$5, and second from $5-$10). I have not yet figured this out and is a work in progress.

I am still very new to this and learning as I go. I use this on products that are already $0. So there is no risk for me if ever there is a bypass in the Min/Max but I of course if there are better ways to optimize, that would be great!

Road Map
******* 
1. Optimize the file to have split settings and main code.
2. Option to select multiple categories and have their own settings.
3. Option to select single products instead of a whole category.
4. Optimize the code to have unique names / classes instead of the generic ones I have given it.
5. Fix issue with price validation between min/max where I have to have code to reload the page since the error message only pops up after a refresh.
6. Make the text field better looking.
7. TBD
